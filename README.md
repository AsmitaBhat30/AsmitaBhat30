### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is Asmita :handshake:

ðŸ”­ I am a Master's student at Technical university of Kaiserslautern specializing in Artificial Intelligence.
I am glad to be a part of this awesome platform where I can easily follow interesting contributions from our AI community and also to share my own contributions :)

I am immensely interested in Computer Vision and Statistical ML. 
Owing to my interests, my most recent contribution has been :-

- Conditional GAN (CGAN) for conditional image generation, 
- Evaluating latent representations of attention-based cross-modal Vision-and-language models for text and image semantic matching,

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Hybrid generative models including GANs and VAEs for 2D and 3D shape synthesis and representation learning.

ðŸ‘¯ I also have a sweet spot for Explainable AI and Machine bias and therefore would love to collaborate on some interesting ideas/topics.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
You can find my personal email id in my bio. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I was never a geek but now-a-days I don't mind to breathe/live AI (something that was very hard for me to admit) :wink: :blush:

Last but not the least, I am always open to share / discuss and more importantly debate on interesting topics in AI so please get in touch if you think you have something that interests me. Also, I would be glad to answer any queries or questions on my listed work so please do not hesitate to ask.
