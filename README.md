### Hi there 👋, this is Asmita :handshake:

🔭 I am a Master's student at Technical university of Kaiserslautern specializing in Artificial Intelligence.
I am glad to be a part of this platform since I can easily follow interesting contributions from our AI community and also to share my own contributions :)

I am immensely interested in Computer Vision and Statistical ML. 
Owing to my interests, my most recent contributions have been :-

- Conditional GAN (CGAN) for conditional image generation
- Evaluating latent representations of attention-based cross-modal Vision-and-language models for text and image semantic matching

🔭 I’m currently working on
- Hybrid generative models including GANs and VAEs for 2D and 3D shape synthesis and representation learning.
- Layout-to-Image synthesis with disentanglement for multiple objects in an image with minimal supervision.

👯 I also have a sweet spot for Explainable AI and Machine bias and therefore would love to collaborate on some interesting ideas/topics.

📫 How to reach me:
You can find my personal email id in my bio. 

Last but not the least, I am always open to share / discuss and more importantly debate on interesting topics in AI so please get in touch if you think you have something that interests me. Also, I would be glad to answer any queries or questions on my listed work so please do not hesitate to ask.
